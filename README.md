Hi, I'm Joe, I am a private investigator, computer crime investigator, digital forensics investigator and I work with network security issues.
Here you will find code that I've written for projects and for use on cases I have needed code for.
I've worked for the CIA, DOJ, AOL, and Avaya,  now I work for myself.
